<h1>Hospital Patient Management System</h1>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<h3>A hospital seeks to enhance operational efficiency by implementing a robust Patient Management System. This system must efficiently handle patient records, doctor appointments, treatment history, and hospital performance metrics. It should support the storage of electronic health records (EHR), patient demographics, medical diagnoses, treatment history, and doctor information. Additionally, it must enable analysis of patient demographics, disease prevalence, treatment outcomes, and hospital performance indicators to improve decision-making and service delivery.</h3>

<h2>Tables</h2>
<h3>1) Patients: Stores patient demographics.</h3>
<h3>2) Doctors: Stores doctor information and specialization.</h3>
<h3>3) MedicalRecords: Stores medical records, including admission dates, discharge
dates, diagnoses, treatments, and associated doctor IDs.</h3>
